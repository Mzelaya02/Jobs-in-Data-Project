# Jobs_in_Data-Project
Project Proposal: 

Nowadays, several roles/categories are involved in the data-related job market. For example, a few include 'Data Engineer,' 'Data Analyst,' 'Data Architect,' etc. Since there are many job titles in the data field, I want to predict which job roles/categories will most likely be in need and the most reliable in the future. The owner of the dataset, Hummaam Qaasim, calls the dataset that I will be using "Jobs and Salaries in Data Science", which I found on Kaggle. In total, the dataset has 12 columns and 9,356 rows. As for modeling, I plan on using three potential predictive models: the nearest neighbor, random forest, and gradient boosting algorithms. In addition, as a baseline for evaluating predictive models, I am interested in using linear/logistic regression to compare the accuracy scores with the other three predictive models I will use with my data. As for tools, I plan on using the Python programming language. In addition, as for libraries in Python, I plan to use numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and sklearn. Lastly, as for visualization tools, I plan on using Python and Tableau. I firmly believe these steps can push me in the right direction to clean the data, perform explanatory data analysis (EDA), and ultimately produce the most accurate predictive model. All in all, technology and the data industry are constantly evolving rapidly. Should data science as a career be a cause for worry?

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

In summary, after exploring and testing many different types of EDA, it can demonstrate how salary depends on different factors and can fluctuate in the data industry. In addition, the data set only focuses on a few interval data types like work year and salary. The rest of the columns are all nominal data, which means they must change from categorical to numerical data to make future salary predictions work and be as accurate as possible. The only way to make this change is by using the one-hot encoding, as you demonstrated in class, by transferring the categorical variables into a numerical layout before splitting and testing with the ML algorithms. Finally, I enjoyed exploring and learning more about different variables affecting salaries in the data field. 

Celebration of Student Research and Creativity Poster:

I designed, created, and presented a poster presentation for the Celebration of Student Research & Creativity, which includes the objectives, materials and methods, results, and future work of my semester-long data analytics project.

Predictive Analytics Model:

For my semester-long project, I developed a preliminary predictive analytics model by implementing three different models, including K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, to predict salary prediction through jobs in the data field. Although the accuracy score was not initially what I had hoped for, it improved significantly after making a few adjustments. A few specific examples included using the original dataset and returning the few columns I dropped before: ' job_title', 'salary_currency', 'salary', and 'employee_residence'. In addition, since the dataset also includes data from jobs in the data field worldwide, I also got rid of the new column I created, which was called 'country_category'. It described whether a job was either in the 'United States' or 'Non-United States', which I thought after implementing the one-hot encoding it would simplify working with the dataset and not create too many columns, but I was wrong.

Overall, I enjoyed working with this dataset by applying explanatory data analysis to analyze the data and performing multiple machine learning models like K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to predict the best accuracy possible. This project was a somewhat frustrating but humbling experience. Any feedback or suggestions would be greatly appreciated! 

Project Final Presentation:

I created a PowerPoint presentation for my predictive analytics semester-long project for predicting job salaries within the data industry based on project overview, explanatory data analysis (EDA), methods/modeling, preliminary results, final results, conclusion/future work, and reflection.
